PostgreSQL tuple format specification.

## Preface

This document is an attempt to reverse-engineer tuple format specification as generated by PostgreSQL,
since no official documentation could be located while writing this library.

## Definition

In this document, by `tuple` we refer to string presentation for custom types, as supported by PostgreSQL,
i.e. a tuple is a result of serializing a custom data structure into a text string. 

When a `tuple` contains fields of another custom type, such structure is referred to as a `composite tuple`. 

A composite tuple can be of any complexity, including:

* Tuple arrays of any number of dimensions
* Composite tuple arrays of any number of dimensions
